**#COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization Project Overview**

This project leverages **SQL, Excel, and Tableau** to analyze and visualize global COVID-19 data. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from the data, clean and prepare it for analysis, and create a comprehensive Tableau dashboard that presents these insights in a visually compelling manner. This project showcases my ability to handle end-to-end data analysis tasks, from querying and data cleaning to visualization and dashboard creation.

**Project Workflow**

**Data Extraction and SQL Queries:**

The initial step involved querying a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset using SQL. I crafted four distinct queries to capture various aspects of the pandemic, such as total cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination rates across different countries and regions.
Each query was executed to generate a result set, which was then exported to Excel worksheets for further processing.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation in Excel:**

Upon exporting the SQL query results, I performed a meticulous data cleaning process in Excel. 

This included:

1.Converting NULL values to 0 for columns containing numerical data, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the subsequent visualizations.

2.Formatting and structuring the data to align with Tableauâ€™s requirements for seamless integration.

3.These cleaned datasets were saved as Excel worksheets and served as the foundation for the visual analysis in Tableau.

**Data Visualization in Tableau:**

The cleaned Excel worksheets were imported into Tableau, where I created a variety of visualizations to uncover trends and patterns in the COVID-19 data. 

**The visualizations included:**

**Tables:** Detailed tabular representation of key statistics, allowing for easy comparison across countries and regions.

**Bar Charts:** Visual breakdown of COVID-19 metrics, such as cases and deaths, facilitating quick identification of the most affected areas.

**Geographical Maps:** Interactive maps highlighting the global spread of the virus, with color-coded regions to depict varying levels of impact.
These visualizations were designed to be intuitive, informative, and interactive, enabling users to explore the data from multiple perspectives.

**Dashboard Creation:**

The final step involved assembling all the visualizations into a cohesive Tableau dashboard. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the global COVID-19 situation, with interactive elements allowing users to drill down into specific metrics or regions of interest.
The dashboard is designed with a focus on clarity and usability, making it a powerful tool for both data analysts and decision-makers.

**Key Features**
**End-to-End Data Pipeline:** Demonstrates proficiency in SQL for data extraction, Excel for data cleaning, and Tableau for data visualization.
**Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly Tableau dashboard that presents critical insights into the global COVID-19 pandemic.
**Data Accuracy:** Meticulous data cleaning ensures that the visualizations are based on accurate and reliable data.
**Versatility in Visualization:** The project showcases a wide range of visualization techniques, from bar charts to geographical maps, each tailored to highlight different aspects of the data.

**Conclusion**

This project exemplifies my ability to manage the entire data analysis process, from initial data extraction and cleaning to creating sophisticated visualizations and dashboards in Tableau. It demonstrates my technical skills, attention to detail, and ability to convey complex data in a visually engaging manner. This project is an ideal example of how I can bring value to any data-driven role.
